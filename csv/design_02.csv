record_id,2. How would you order these elements based on priority?
1,"Conspecific, viewing social interactions"
2,"complex visual stimuli, faces, objects"
3,NA
4,N/A
5,"- conspecific and human voices (multiple call types, for human both speech and non speech)  - natural sounds (artificial and heterospecific sounds)  - conspecific and human  faces / bodies   - tones with different frequencies"
6,No
7,N/A
8,eye
9,N/A
10,N/A
11,N/A
12,"faces, shapes, specific sounds"
13,Movies first
14,"All these elements are important. What is critical is that the stimuli need to be standardised in terms of duration, resolution, play speed, dimension etc."
15,"faces, conspecific, vocalizations"
16,NA
17,N/A
18,Conspecifics; movment; vocalizatoin; faces; other.
19,NA
20,"interactions, social and non-social, faces, individuals, bodies"
21,"Faces and fruits, hand actions, faces, and vocalizations"
22,faces - objects - moving dots
23,NA
24,Given the list of elements provided I would prioritize social and non-social interactions.

29,1. conspecifics (faces+bodies) engaged in social interactions  2. conspecifics (faces+bodies) engaged in non-social interactions: e.g. moving around / foraging / eating / resting etc.   3. high value non-social items: e.g. food / high value foraging places (inferred from context)  4. vocalization
30,NA
31,N/A
32,"I think this would be difficult to do as the field has a large number of priorities, but for me personally, I would order it as high level features first (Faces, body parts, vocalizations), then down to lower level features like (color, motion, shapes).  The higher level features have shown more variability in localization than say MT, so the need for a localizer may be higher."
33,N/A
34,NA
35,"Would be helpful if localizer included monkey faces, objects, and perhaps bodies."
36,N/A
37,N.A.
38,"Conditioned reward stimuli, Object database, Face database, Social grooming pictures"
39,I would randomly mix them. The analysis could use tags on scenes to dissociate the different contents and analyze functional connectivity during a single scene across scans/animals/labs.
40,N/A
41,"Include stimuli where we already have good data on as control, but also those that are still missing"
42,"Vision, then sound"
43,NA
44,NA
45,"NA"
46,"As above, but open to hypothesis-driven ranking."

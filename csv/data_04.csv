record_id,4. Do you rely primarily on volume or surface-based approaches for inter-subject registration? Is there a particular reason as to why?
1,"Depends on the region. Surface based work much better for cortical regions, but volume is more suitable for subcortical regions."
2,"I use both. For human post-mortem I use surface-based, because of the weird shape changes to the brain. For human in-vivo I have used BBR & ANTs (volume-based).     For the monkey I have used volume-based. As there are fewer sulci, I wonder is there less of an advantage of surface-based registration?"
3,Currently relying on volume-based. It is not always easy to generate individual-subject surface from T1 anatomical data. Would be nice to have a freesurfer-like pipeline that does that for NHPs
4,"We actually develop methods to register subjects together in a surface-based way.  There are a reasons why:  - We are interested in cortical organisation and sulcal anatomy, best described on the surface.  - We also want to establish correspondences with humans and other primates for which we already have surface-based models of cortical organisation."
5,only at the subject level for the moment
6,We prefer a surface-based approach because it reduces the mistakes of 'kissing gyrus'  and it is possible to use the surface for other analysis.

9,The surface-based approaches are preferred but volume-based is also important for segmentation and subcortical analysis.

15,"volume based seems to give better registration. There is a higher degree of variability in surface based markers, but in small areas, surface may be better,"
16,Volume data has more information than the surface data.
17,"Volume; easier, more commonly available"
18,"Volume registration. Surface registration does not align subcortical structures -- it confuses me why one might ignore a large portion of the brain. Surface registration is a great complement, but if we as a field had to pick one, I can't imagine it wouldn't be volume."
19,we use a combination
20,surface-based approach- Surface-based registration provided significantly better alignment of cortical landmarks than volume-based registration.
21,I typically use a volume-based approach as I could keep control over the entire dimensionally of the data. This is particularly important if neurosurgical techniques are to be applied to MR data.
22,either
23,volume-based
24,volume-based approaches as surface-based approaches are less successful for subcortical and intra-cortical structures (e.g. the insular cortex).
25,NA
26,I do use the surface based inter-subject registration for data normalization.
27,We do both
28,both
29,Volume : much more precise and accurate
30,Volume-based approache.  Our study are also focused on deep structures like Thalamus.
31,Volume works best in rodents  (*Please note this applies to rodents - feel free to scrap this from the answer pool if not applicable*)
32,Volume based registration and analyses.  Subcortical structures and regions are often critical to my analyses.
33,"So far, we only analyzed activation maps in individual subjects separately (using mainly native AC-PC volume data), and the analysis across animals was performed using ROI timecourse analysis. One of the reasons to use volume approach is the interest in subcortical structures; the other reason is arguably more precise localization of activation to e.g. dorsal/ventral bank or fundus (e.g. sts) or lateral/medial bank (e.g. ips). We co-register the atlas data (e.g. https://scalablebrainatlas.incf.org/macaque/CBCetal15) to each individual animal to facilitate the identification of ROIs; therefore, we are definitely interested in an standardized way to co-register volume data to an atlas or a template."
34,NA
35,Volume based.   Volume has more information for registering subjects and surface maps are currently hard to generate (but CIVET-macaque will do this) and are prone to errors that would distort surface registration.
36,Surface-based for the cortex; CIFTI grayordinates for cortical vertices  + subcortical gray matter voxels; CIFTI whiteordinates for white matter voxels. We consider these methods to be substantially more accurate.
37,N.A.
38,Volume only. Surface based approaches have some utility in the sensory domain but do not scale well to the analysis non topographically organized cortex. Additionally surface based approaches are not very usable for subcortical structures
39,"Volume because I care about sub-cortex. It also allows better normalization/registration ... and part of the success of the current effort will be to have optimal inter-subject registration to a standard scan.    In fact, together with George Paxinos and Michael Petrides, we are currently revising the macaque brain atlas for its 4th edition, and we will propose a comprehensive template with cortical and subcortical ROIs, and with a grouping of small ROIs, too. We will also propose a step-by-step protocol to semi-manually coregister individual brains to the template."
40,Surface-based for the cortex; CIFTI grayordinates for cortex  + subcortical gray matter; CIFTI whiteordinatess for white matter. These methods are more accurate.

1,Haven't acquired NHP data myself
2,No
3,NO
4,N/A
5,"MION , from 11mg/kg to 8-9 during a continuous period of scanning (one session per day)     Then we use at the end Desferal to remove the accumulated iron."
6,3. We don't use contrast agents

16,"Following the method of Landi and Freiwald 2017, Sliwa and Freiwald 2017, a MRI contrast agent Molday ION (BioPAL, Inc) was injected at iron doses of 8 mg/kg into femoral vein of macaque monkey before scanning.    1.

17,No
18,No.
19,Always for functional imaging. Currently we use Molday (~ 10mg/kg)
20,iDK
21,No MION and no contrast agents. At least at 4T (BOLD) 1 single movie run 5 minutes (30-sec movie segments 5 repeats) can provide FDR-corrected significant activation maps with greater than 3% signal change from the mean.
22,"currently not, prior Feraheme or Molday ION, CLIOH, 8-10 mg/kg"
23,No
24,only BOLD at the moment

27,"We have experimented with gadolinium and fluorinert to improve tissue contrast (but the person who knows is our MR physicist, Mathieu Santin from ICM)"
28,gadolinium and fluorinert have been tested --> Mathieu Santin from ICM Paris is the expert
29,Molday Ion  10mg/kg
30,"- iron-based contrast agent (SINEREM, MION, FERAHEME) at 10 mg/kg in IV  - pure BOLD signal"
31,"yes for fucntional imaging - Molday Ion, 2.5 (5 ul/g i.v.)  (*Please note this applies to rodents - feel free to scrap this from the answer pool if not applicable*)"
32,We are using MION (Molday 10-12mg/kg).
33,"We mainly used BOLD for fMRI so far, and some pilot microstimulation-fMRI sedated scans with MION (Rienso ferumoxytol 30 mg/ml).    We use Gadolinium (Magnevist) for injection localizations (1:200 Gd to PBS)."
34,yes MION for fMRI on awake macaques.  Gd for perfusion MRI on some projects
35,"house-made MION, 12-18 mg/Kg, to achieve a 50-60% signal reduction relative to EPI signal before MION."

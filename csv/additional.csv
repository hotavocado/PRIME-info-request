1,Excited to discuss NHP imaging!

3,What is an appropriate HRF for macaques and other NHP species?  Should we have a 'canonical' awake macaque HRF? How does anesthesia affect the HRF?

20,I would like to see more about data acquisition
21,"In general, use innovative movie (or complex music/sound) paradigms with increasing natural complexity to capture the propagation of network information across a large number of regions will be a very good and simple addition to standardized paradigms. Avoid the used of standard-trial by trail type paradigms as these will complicate the compilation of a large number of animals with different performances and task strategies etc. Performance in the scanner becomes variable and tedious for monkeys and they tend to perform way fewer trials as compared to when performing the task on a neurophysiological or behavioral booth."
22,It would be helpful to know if anyone has a fieldmap sequence that can be acquired with the same spatial resolution as the EPI sequences.

27,"I suggest storing shared data in Zenodo, as individual files (instead of as a single large .zip)"
28,"access to single datasets would be nice (like using zenodo (or figshare)  I prefer a (BIDSified) naming scheme where the species name is still somehow visible. You provide mostly crab-eating and rhesus macaques -- but even in these cases, I like better the naming you provide in utrecht site than in others)"

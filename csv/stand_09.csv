record_id,8. What do you use for distortion correction and acquisition for Mion vs BOLD sequences?
1,Haven't acquired NHP data myself
2,"We just did BOLD-imaging. We used multi-echo-multi-band, with multi-echo ICA de-noising. For distortion correction, we used TOP-UP for distortion correction (having acquired some volumes with the opposite phase-encoding direction)."
3,NA
4,N/A
5,na
6,We do not use contrast agents
7,"N4 (ants), topup"
8,N.A.
9,FSL TOPUP for BOLD sequences.

16,EPI distortion correction with two opposite encoding phase.

18,I'm experimenting with top-up. It appears to be taking a step in the right direction...
19,W use as short TEs as possible (depends on scanner specs).
20,NA
21,"I don't think MION is required for the reliable acquisition of NHP imaging data. Thus, I refrain from using MION."
22,NA
23,"Reconstruction tools provided by Hauke Kolster, or Mark Chiew (WIN, Oxford)"
24,Using only BOLD sequences - unwarping by fieldmap or point-spread-correction of EPI distortion map
25,NA
26,Standard Old Normalization and two way brain masking and re-alignment

31,Just 12 dof registration - MION are much less distorted so no correction is required.   (*Please note this applies to rodents - feel free to scrap this from the answer pool if not applicable*)
32,We are currently using a set of forward and reverse phase direction Spin Echo images for distortion correction.  We collect a set both before and after MION injection in case MION has an effect on the distortion.
33,BOLD only with Fieldmap  Plan to use TopUp https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/topup/Faq with FSL
34,same sequence
35,Place scan to correct for field inhomogeneities.    TE ~17 ms for BOLD and 13 ms for MION.

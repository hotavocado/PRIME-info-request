32,"We use a combination of multiple software packages for data analysis, with a majority of our preprocessing steps being run with AFNI, after trial and error with multiple packages.  Currently, we are using the nipype python package to run select programs from ANTs, AFNI, and FSL. In addition to this homemade pipeline, we are working on moving our preprocessing pipeline to C-PAC for a more compact package.   After preprocessing, we tend to use MATLAB and AFNI for specific data analyses based on the given project."

(2016), but we prefer in general our own manual registrations, with a GUI developed by Yusuke Murayma (MPI) and later adapted based on our needs. Renee also probably looked at FreeSurfer and other packages."

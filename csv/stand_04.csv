record_id,"4. If you use anesthesia, what specific type and levels do you use?"
1,Haven't acquired NHP data myself
2,isoflurane 1.0-1.6%
3,"Isoflurane (in intubated and mechanically ventilated animals), concentrations vary (1-2%)  Propofol, infusion rates vary depending on age, weight, physiological monitoring,"
4,N/A
5,"We use Domitor  to do the IV injection of MION , then we remove the anesthesic with a product called antisedan juste before the scanning session"
6,Ketamine-xylazine (7/0.6 mg/kg)
7,N/A
8,Propofol
9,"Initial dose: atropine (0.05 mg/kg IM), dexdomitor (0.02 mg/kg IM) and ketamine (8 mg/kg IM) for intubation;   maintaining dose: 0.75% isoflurane anesthesia"
10,Ketamine-xylazine (7/0.6 mg/kg)
11,N/A
12,N/A
13,NA
14,"Atropine was applied via subcutaneous injection 20min before anesthesia (dosage = body weight * 0.05mg/kg).  ZoletilTM 50# was used via subcutaneous injection (dosage = body weight * 0.1ml/kg)  After the monkeys were head-fixed on the Stereotaxic, 0.3ml ZoletilTM 50# was injected."
15,Isoflurane at 1%.
16,"Animals were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg) and maintained with propofol (5 mg/kg/hr, induction 5mg/kg) or sufentanil (2-4 µg/kg/hr, induction 3 µg/kg) supplemented with up to 1% isoflurane."
17,Isoflurane 1-3% in 0.3-0.5l/min O2
18,"Ketamine for intubation and isoflurane, 1-2%."
19,barely ever. If we perform anesthesia it is either isoflurane or ketamine/xylazine
20,NA
21,I do not recommend the use of anesthesia for functional scans EPI sequences. It is much easier to do awake-fMRI. It is very difficult to keep the animal under anesthesia under 1% isoflurane. The anesthesia cocktail with muscle paralysis was very effective but remains controversial given the potential masking of nociceptive signals.
22,"Isoflurane, <1% for resting state, 1.5% for anatomy"
23,Isoflurane (around 1%)
24,"Anesthesia used - remifentanil for functional imaging, isoflurane just for structural scans"
25,NA
26,N/A
27,no need
28,n.a. (all post mortem)
29,isofurane 1-2%
30,"- Sevoflurane (moderate sedation: 2% ; deep sedation 4% - inhaled volume)  - Propofol (moderate sedation: 3.7 to 4.0 μg/ml ; deep sedation 5.6 to 7.2 μg/ml - IV, based on the Paedfusor pharmacokinetic model)  - Ketamine & Dexmedetomodine (IM injection, then IV infusion 5 to 16 mg/kg/h to maintain)"
31,"Halothane 0.7% (intubation), isoflurane 0.8% intubation  (*Please note this applies to rodents - feel free to scrap this from the answer pool if not applicable*)"
32,For about half our scans we use anesthesia.  We induce with 5mg/kg Ketamine and .15mg/kg Dexdomitor. We then maintain the anesthesia on 0.75% isoflurane during functional imaging.
33,"For full anesthesia, mainly isoflurane 1-1.5% (for the resting state fMRI) or propofol (for the anatomical scans with MRI-compatible stereotax).  For sedated scans in the MRI chair, Ketamin/Dexdomitor or only Dexdomitor (in particular when the animal is trained to enter the MRI horizontal chair)."
34,NA
35,generally none.  Sometimes we use light sedation:   Vallium (i.m. only or equal parts i.m. and i.v.) or Vallium + Ketamine.  Isoflourane for high resolution anatomical scans
36,Dexmedetmidine 4-6microgram/kg/hr + 0.5-0.6% isoflurane in macaque and marmoset
37,N.A.
38,"Isoflurane, 1% for anesthetized scans"
39,"remifentanil (1-3 µg/kg/min, analgesic and anesthetic)  mivacurium chloride (5-7 mg/kg/h, muscle relaxant)"
40,Dexmedetmidine 4-6microgram/kg/hr + 0.5-0.6% isoflurane in macaque and marmoset

45,Awake imaging.
46,"Generally, we scan awake. For 'arrival' or 'localization' scans in non-MRI dedicated animals we use a mixture of Ketamine (0.07 ml/kg, at 100 mg/ml) and Medetomidine (0.1 ml/kg, at 1 mg/ml)"
47,Isoflurane (0.5-2.0%)
